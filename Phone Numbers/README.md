# Phone Numbers
This is a collection of PowerShell scripts I've written that are related to the phone # fields of Active Directory.

My previous employer had their associate's Direct Inward Dialing and Cell Phone numbers listed in 2 separate spreadsheets
and in 2 different locations on the network's Distributed File System. My manager assigned me with updating Active Directory 
to reflect all of the employees phone numbers in one location. The intention for this was to display these details quickly and efficiently by clicking on a users Contact Details in Microsoft Outlook.
